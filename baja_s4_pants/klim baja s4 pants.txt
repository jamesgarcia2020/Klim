BAJA S4 PANT

The Baja S4 Pant was born for open deserts, towering sand dunes and humid jungles. Featuring extensive 4-way stretch zones and durable Schoeller®-Dynatec® nylon mesh – specially mapped with a lightweight liner for unrestricted airflow – the Baja S4 delivers thorough airflow for hot weather adventure riding. Engineered with excellent flexibility for dynamic off-road riding, while ceramic-plated Superfabric® offers outstanding on-road protection. Paired with the waterproof Enduro S4, the Baja S4 kit is the ultimate adventure riding setup for maximum versatility.
